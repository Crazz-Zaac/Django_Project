# Bytes Nepal
This is a very minimalistic version of a website that you can see it [here](https://bytesnepal.herokuapp.com/). I designed taking references from different videos and online tutorials. This is indeed my first django project. I had no idea what was going on but through debugging I learnt a lot and had successfully through this project. It was absolutely a challenging and exciting journey. I have done very less or almost not done much with the database. Because my finals were round the corne, I could not give a good ending. I have worked more on the backend than the UI. 

## Getting started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

## Prerequisites
```python3 
django 
virtual environment
Text editor(visual studio, sublime text, vim, atom)
Heroku
Git hub
```
## Installations
You must install the virtual environment for not facing the problem of python version dependencies as well as other library packages dependencies.
You can set up your virtual environment, install django and create your first test project following the Digital Ocean tutorial [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-django-web-framework-on-ubuntu-18-04)

Once you have followed the steps there, you can clone this repository and with your virtual environment activated, you can install other PyPi(Python Package Index) files by typing:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt ``` 

Make sure you have installed pip3. You can get the latest updated version of the packages from the official website of [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)

## Deployment
For deploying I recommend [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Click the link to know more about it. As with the deploying process you can follow the tutorial [here](https://www.codementor.io/jamesezechukwu/how-to-deploy-django-app-on-heroku-dtsee04d4) or [here](https://gist.github.com/giantas/85181a9a5cc84aec845de3335d6c41e0).
